HELLO EVERYBODY

This is my graduation project

In order to solve the problem that the storage space of the wardrobe in the dormitory of female college students on campus is limited, 
and the clothes are inconvenient to be placed and sorted, resulting in the unclear style of the existing clothes, 
which affects the clothing collocation and repeated purchase. 
Therefore, based on eclipse and Android Studio development platform, using MySQL and SQLite database technology, 
using java language to design and develop my wardrobe application software, to achieve effective management of clothing information,
record and preset a variety of clothing matching, reduce the trouble of rummaging, collect clothing matching inspiration, 
improve their own clothing matching ability, and confirm their own clothing style In order to avoid blindly following the trend,
reduce the idle clothing and repeat purchase of similar items, and reduce environmental pollution
